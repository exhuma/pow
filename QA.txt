Hi /r/vuejs

*tl;dr:* I would appreciate an audit of [my code][1] for everything concerning
vuejs (and maybe JS).

----

I've recently written my first vue.js application and it currently implements
the functional requirements and has become usable. There's still a lot of work
o do, but I would be *really* interested in getting some feedback. Especially
since I haven't written any substantial JS app since 1998, and a lot has
changes since then!

I've sprinklded the term `REDDIT` (in all caps) throughout the code-base with
some specific questions (20 in total). I'm still unsure where/how certain
things work, and am not quite sure if all questions are vuejs related, but I
reckon that this is the right place to ask.

The things I am *most* interested in are vuejs specifics. As I'm using vuejs, I
want to do things the "vuejs way".

Other stuff I use:

* vuetify
* axios
* webpack (from the vuejs template)

So apart from the questions inside the code, here are some additional notes &
qusetions:

* Some architectural smells:
    * **The way "assignments" are structured.** This is a remnant of the first
      prototype and will be improved on eventually. But for now it works and
      does what it should. I'm not going to touch it for now!
    * **Potential overusage of the vuex state (unsure about this one).** I see
      the `vuex` state as state for the frontend UI. Right now I keep stuff in
      the state which is not visible to the user. I wonder if it would not be
      better to keep one state per route/"view" to avoid reproducing too much
      application logic in the client state.
* **Use the "baseUrl" configuration of axios instead of a global variable.**
  I've found out about the `baseUrl` configuration in axios only after having
  most of the stuff working. I'm aware of this and will change it whenever
  possible. Not quite high on my list of priorities.
* **Split up main.js** How do I go about this? I'm wildly guessing that I could
  write modules which I can import and webpack does it's thing. But I'm not
  quite sue how/where to start.
* **Hardcoded colors all over the place.** In the vuetify exampes they assign
  colors using `class` attributes. I could of course write my own classes and
  add the colors there. But given that the palettes are well-defined in
  Material Design, I was wondering if there's not something predefined
  somewhere. I also found the `primary` and `secondary` attributes in vuetify,
  but can't seem to find the area where you define your primary and secondary
  colours.
* There are several "<Foo>List" commponents all behaving the same way. I smell
  a potential to merge them all into one custom component.
